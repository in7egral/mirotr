MirOTR - OTR for Miranda IM!
Description
MirOTR is a plugin for Miranda IM only that offers OTR (Off-the-Record) encryption plugin support for the most used protocols like e.g. ICQ, Facebook. The main source was taken from the outdated and no longer supported OTR plugin (thanks sje for that!).

It's aim is to become a feature-complete equivalent to Pidgin's OTR plugin.
